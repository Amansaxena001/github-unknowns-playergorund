This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Install dependencies`

**npm install

### `Manually Setup GitHub API Access ID and Secret`

create a .env file in the root of your folder and add REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID and REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
and provide them with your id and secret obtained by creating an app on github-api.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Days wise progress

Day 1. Boiler Plate code setup with some packages such as Axios, antD design.
Day 2. Setting up gitApi to start developing core functionalities.
Day 3. Implementation of components making wireframes to reality.
Day 4. Testing App to see everything working fine.
FINAL- Merging development branch to master.
